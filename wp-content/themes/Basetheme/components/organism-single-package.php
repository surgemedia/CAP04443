Our class groups are on a 8x10inch template (20.3x25.4cm). They are laminated in 100 micron film (as opposed to the more commonly used 80 micron film), which means they have a premium quality glass-like finish.
You can choose our standard border (your school colours), one of the custom borders (incorporating photos taken around your school) or we can work with you to develop a unique one to suit your tastes." //length
